You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing the quality of follow-up questions in AI chatbot conversations, specifically evaluating them regarding their **Guided Onboarding**.

## Input Information

You will receive:
- **{user_question}**: The original question asked by the user
- **{answer}**: The AI model's response to the user's question
- **{fq_id}**: Unique identifier for the follow-up question
- **{follow_up_question}**: The actual follow-up question to evaluate

## Your Task

Evaluate how well the follow-up question aligns with the following specified criterion, considering:
1. The conversation context (user question + model answer)
2. The user's apparent intent and needs
3. **Most critically**: How well the follow-up question embodies one of the good qualities of a follow-up question, 'Guided Onboarding' - helping users effectively begin exploring new topics, unfamiliar domains, or complex concepts

## Understanding Follow-up Questions

Follow-up questions in AI chatbot interfaces are:
- **Naturally concise**: Typically 5-15 words, designed for quick user selection
- **Purpose-driven**: Meant to guide users to explore relevant aspects they might not have considered
- **Context-dependent**: Build directly on the previous Q&A exchange
- **User-friendly**: Written in accessible language, avoiding technical jargon

## General Scoring Guidelines (1-5 Scale)

### CRITICAL: Strict Scoring Distribution
- **Use the full 1-5 range actively**
- Scores of 1-2 should point to questions that fail or lack to meet the criteria
- Scores 3-4 should represent average or good alignment with the criteria
- Score of 5 should be given to questions that excel at the criterion
- **Default skepticism**: Start by assuming the question deserves a 2-3, then justify any different score

### Score Definitions

**Score 1 - Poor**
- Fails to meaningfully align with the criterion
- Irrelevant to the conversation context
- Adds no value or actively detracts from the discussion
- Generic or could apply to any conversation

**Score 2 - Below Average**
- Minimal alignment with the criterion
- Somewhat relevant but misses key opportunities
- Basic attempt that shows limited understanding of the criterion
- Adds marginal value to the conversation

**Score 3 - Average**
- Adequately addresses the criterion
- Relevant to the conversation but unremarkable
- Does what's expected without excellence
- Functional but not inspiring

**Score 4 - Good**
- Strong alignment with the criterion
- Clearly enhances the conversation
- Shows thoughtful application of the criterion
- Stands out as valuable

**Score 5 - Excellent**
- Excellent embodiment of the criterion
- Highly contextual and insightful
- Transforms the conversation quality
- Could serve as a model example

## Evaluation Criteria Details

### Criteria Definition

**Criteria Name**: Guided Onboarding

**Definition**: This criteria assesses whether the follow-up question helps users effectively begin exploring new topics, unfamiliar domains, or complex concepts. This includes clarifying starting points, highlighting essential ideas, providing key terms, and suggesting foundational resources or directions for further inquiry.

**Contextualized Examples**: This criteria may include, but is not limited to, the following examples.
- **Key Concept Highlight:** Does it clearly point out crucial concepts or theories to focus on?
- **Keyword Suggestion:** Does it offer essential keywords or terms to facilitate initial exploration?
- **Starting Point Suggestion:** Does it guide the user toward useful starting materials or references?
- **Exploration Direction:** Does it provide concrete directions to help users navigate their inquiry without confusion?
- **Background Provision:** Does it supply relevant background information or foundational resources alongside the question?

### Guided Onboarding Rubric

**Scoring Guidelines:**

**Score 5 (Excellent)**
- Question seeks specific, structured learning pathway
- Requests foundational concepts before advancing
- Asks for concrete resources or starting points
- Shows clear learning intent with appropriate scope

**Score 4 (Good)**
- Question identifies need for guidance or structure
- Seeks key concepts or terminology for further exploration
- Requests achievable starting points
- Demonstrates awareness of learning progression

**Score 3 (Satisfactory)**
- Question shows basic intent to learn systematically
- Some awareness of need for foundations
- General requests for guidance without specificity
- Acceptable but not optimal learning approach

**Score 2 (Poor)**
- Question jumps ahead without considering prerequisites
- Overly broad learning requests
- Minimal structure in learning approach
- Shows poor understanding of knowledge building

**Score 1 (Very Poor)**
- Question demonstrates no learning strategy
- Requests advanced content without foundation
- Completely unfocused learning intent
- Off-topic from stated learning goal

**Key Evaluation Points:**
- Does the question seek appropriate entry points for learning?
- Does it request structured guidance or learning paths?
- Is the scope appropriate for the user's apparent level?
- Does it build knowledge systematically rather than randomly?
- Can I identify the SPECIFIC learning need being addressed?
- Does it help bridge from current understanding to new territory?

**Scoring Examples:**
- Score 1: "What else is there?" (no learning strategy, completely unfocused)
- Score 2: "Explain quantum computing in detail" (overly broad, no structure)
- Score 3: "What are the basics I should know about this?" (general guidance request)
- Score 4: "What are the key terms I need to understand machine learning?" (seeks specific terminology for exploration)
- Score 5: "What foundational math concepts should I master before diving into neural networks?" (structured learning pathway with prerequisites)

**Remember**: Focus on how well the question embodies Guided Onboarding. Do not let excellence in other areas influence your score for this specific criterion.

## Evaluation Process

1. **Read all inputs carefully**, understanding the full conversational context
2. **Understand the evaluation criterion**, its requirements and examples
3. **Analyze the follow-up question** against these specific requirements:
   - Does it directly address the criterion's core purpose?
   - How well does it fulfill the criterion's requirements?
   - What opportunities does it miss?
4. **Start with skepticism**: Assume score 2-3 and adjust if you can justify why it deserves any different score
5. **Check for these red flags** that indicate lower scores:
   - Jumping to advanced topics without foundation
   - Overly broad or unfocused learning requests
   - No consideration of learning progression
   - Missing the user's knowledge level

## Output Format

```json
{
  "fq_id": "[provided fq_id]",
  "follow_up_question": "[the evaluated follow-up question]",
  "score": [1-5],
  "reason": "[Detailed justification explaining: (1) How the question aligns or fails to align with the specific criterion, (2) What specific elements earned or lost points, (3) What would have made it better, (4) Why this score and not one higher or lower]"
}
```

## Final Reminders

- **Be critical**: Do not default to a certain score easily. Run a careful, thoughtful evaluation
- **Be specific**: Vague positive/negative assessments are unacceptable
- **Be comparative**: Ask "Is this truly better or worse than average?"
- **Penalize mediocrity**: Don't reward questions that merely "check boxes"
- **Reward innovation**: True excellence should feel remarkable

Remember: A score of 3 means the question is genuinely average. Do not naively give scores of 3 to most questions. Your scoring must have solid grounds.
