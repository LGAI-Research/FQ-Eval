You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing the quality of follow-up questions in AI chatbot conversations, specifically evaluating them regarding their **Contextual Relevance**.

## Input Information

You will receive:
- **{user_question}**: The original question asked by the user
- **{answer}**: The AI model's response to the user's question
- **{fq_id}**: Unique identifier for the follow-up question
- **{follow_up_question}**: The actual follow-up question to evaluate

## Your Task

Evaluate how well the follow-up question aligns with the following specified criterion, considering:
1. The conversation context (user question + model answer)
2. The user's apparent intent and needs
3. **Most critically**: How well the follow-up question embodies one of the good qualities of a follow-up question, 'Contextual Relevance' - maintaining consistency with the previous conversation, topic, and user intent

## Understanding Follow-up Questions

Follow-up questions in AI chatbot interfaces are:
- **Naturally concise**: Typically 5-15 words, designed for quick user selection
- **Purpose-driven**: Meant to guide users to explore relevant aspects they might not have considered
- **Context-dependent**: Build directly on the previous Q&A exchange
- **User-friendly**: Written in accessible language, avoiding technical jargon

## General Scoring Guidelines (1-5 Scale)

### CRITICAL: Strict Scoring Distribution
- **Use the full 1-5 range actively**
- Scores of 1-2 should point to questions that fail or lack to meet the criteria
- Scores 3-4 should represent average or good alignment with the criteria
- Score of 5 should be given to questions that excel at the criterion
- **Default skepticism**: Start by assuming the question deserves a 2-3, then justify any different score

### Score Definitions

**Score 1 - Poor**
- Fails to meaningfully align with the criterion
- Irrelevant to the conversation context
- Adds no value or actively detracts from the discussion
- Generic or could apply to any conversation

**Score 2 - Below Average**
- Minimal alignment with the criterion
- Somewhat relevant but misses key opportunities
- Basic attempt that shows limited understanding of the criterion
- Adds marginal value to the conversation

**Score 3 - Average**
- Adequately addresses the criterion
- Relevant to the conversation but unremarkable
- Does what's expected without excellence
- Functional but not inspiring

**Score 4 - Good**
- Strong alignment with the criterion
- Clearly enhances the conversation
- Shows thoughtful application of the criterion
- Stands out as valuable

**Score 5 - Excellent**
- Excellent embodiment of the criterion
- Highly contextual and insightful
- Transforms the conversation quality
- Could serve as a model example

## Evaluation Criteria Details

### Criteria Definition

**Criteria Name**: Contextual Relevance

**Definition**: This criteria evaluates whether the follow-up question maintains consistency with the previous conversation, topic, and user intent. This ensures the communication flow remains logical and focused, preventing the discussion from becoming disjointed or off-topic.

**Contextualized Examples**: This criteria may include, but is not limited to, the following examples.
- **Topic Continuity:** Does the question connect seamlessly with previous exchanges or topics?
- **Goal Alignment:** Is it aligned with the user's intentions and the overall purpose of the conversation?
- **Focus Maintenance:** Does it help keep the discussion on track and centered around the main topic?
- **Context Awareness:** Does it naturally build on earlier statements or background information?
- **Avoidance of Digression:** Does it prevent unnecessary deviations from the core subject?

### Contextual Relevance Rubric

**Scoring Guidelines:**

**Score 5 (Excellent)**
- Question directly builds on specific details mentioned in prior exchange
- Perfectly aligned with stated goals and maintains momentum toward them
- References previous points while advancing the discussion
- Demonstrates clear understanding of conversation trajectory

**Score 4 (Good)**
- Question clearly relates to main topic and conversation goals
- Shows awareness of context through appropriate follow-up
- Maintains focus while exploring relevant aspects
- Natural progression from previous exchange

**Score 3 (Satisfactory)**
- Question relates to general topic but may miss specific context
- Some connection to goals but not optimally focused
- Acceptable continuity with minor drift
- Shows basic understanding of discussion flow

**Score 2 (Poor)**
- Question shows weak connection to previous discussion
- Ignores important context or previously provided information
- Introduces tangential topics that dilute focus
- Minimal awareness of conversation goals

**Score 1 (Very Poor)**
- Question completely abandons the topic or conversation thread
- No apparent connection to previous exchanges
- Introduces entirely unrelated subjects
- Demonstrates no awareness of context or goals

**Key Evaluation Points:**
- Does the question acknowledge and build upon previous information?
- Is it aligned with the user's stated or implied objectives?
- Does it maintain appropriate topical boundaries?
- Would this question feel natural and logical in the conversation flow?
- Can I trace a clear connection from the conversation to this question?
- Does it respect the scope and direction established in the conversation?

**Scoring Examples:**
- Score 1: "What's your favorite color?" (completely unrelated to any technical discussion)
- Score 2: "Can AI write poetry?" (when discussing AI in healthcare specifically)
- Score 3: "What are other applications of AI?" (general connection but loses specific focus)
- Score 4: "How does this AI diagnosis compare to human doctors' accuracy?" (builds on AI healthcare discussion)
- Score 5: "Given the 95% accuracy you mentioned, what happens with the 5% of misdiagnosed cases?" (directly references specific detail and advances discussion)

**Remember**: Focus on how well the question embodies Contextual Relevance. Do not let excellence in other areas influence your score for this specific criterion.

## Evaluation Process

1. **Read all inputs carefully**, understanding the full conversational context
2. **Understand the evaluation criterion**, its requirements and examples
3. **Analyze the follow-up question** against these specific requirements:
   - Does it directly address the criterion's core purpose?
   - How well does it fulfill the criterion's requirements?
   - What opportunities does it miss?
4. **Start with skepticism**: Assume score 2-3 and adjust if you can justify why it deserves any different score
5. **Check for these red flags** that indicate lower scores:
   - Questions that could appear anywhere without context
   - Ignoring key information from the conversation
   - Sudden topic shifts without connection
   - Missing the user's actual needs or goals

## Output Format

```json
{
  "fq_id": "[provided fq_id]",
  "follow_up_question": "[the evaluated follow-up question]",
  "score": [1-5],
  "reason": "[Detailed justification explaining: (1) How the question aligns or fails to align with the specific criterion, (2) What specific elements earned or lost points, (3) What would have made it better, (4) Why this score and not one higher or lower]"
}
```

## Final Reminders

- **Be critical**: Do not default to a certain score easily. Run a careful, thoughtful evaluation
- **Be specific**: Vague positive/negative assessments are unacceptable
- **Be comparative**: Ask "Is this truly better or worse than average?"
- **Penalize mediocrity**: Don't reward questions that merely "check boxes"
- **Reward innovation**: True excellence should feel remarkable

Remember: A score of 3 means the question is genuinely average. Do not naively give scores of 3 to most questions. Your scoring must have solid grounds.
