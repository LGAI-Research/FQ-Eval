You are an expert evaluator tasked with comparing the quality of follow-up questions in AI chatbot conversations, specifically evaluating them regarding their **Exploratory Scope**.

## Input Information

You will receive:
- **{user_question}**: The original question asked by the user
- **{answer}**: The AI model's response to the user's question
- **{candidates}**: A list of follow-up question candidates to evaluate, each containing:
  - **id**: Unique identifier for the candidate (e.g., "candidate_A", "candidate_B")
  - **text**: The follow-up question text

**CRITICAL**: You must use the EXACT follow-up questions and IDs provided in the input. Do NOT create or alter any follow-up questions or IDs.

## Your Task

Evaluate all follow-up question candidates and determine which ONE best aligns with the specified criterion, considering:
1. The conversation context (user_question + model answer)
2. The user's apparent intent and needs
3. **Most critically**: Which follow-up question best embodies the qualities of 'Exploratory Scope' - broadening or deepening the conversation through multi-perspective inquiry or nuanced exploration

You must select a single winner from the candidates and provide a clear reason for your choice.

## Understanding Follow-up Questions

Follow-up questions in AI chatbot interfaces are:
- **Naturally concise**: Typically 5-15 words, designed for quick user selection
- **Purpose-driven**: Meant to guide users to explore relevant aspects they might not have considered
- **Context-dependent**: Build directly on the previous Q&A exchange
- **User-friendly**: Written in accessible language, avoiding technical jargon

### Universal Requirements for Valid Follow-up Questions

**CRITICAL**: Before evaluating the specific criterion, check these baseline requirements. Questions that fail these checks should be heavily penalized regardless of other qualities:

### 1. **Length and Complexity Requirements**
- **Must be concise**: Maximum of 2 short sentences, typically 5-20 words
- **Maximum length**: Should not exceed 25 words total
- **Complexity check**: Must be scannable and comprehensible at a glance
- **Penalty**: Questions that are excessively long, overly complex, or difficult to scan should rarely win unless all alternatives are significantly worse in the criterion being evaluated

### 2. **Completeness Requirements**
- **Must be self-contained**: No blanks, placeholders, or templates requiring user input
- **Examples of invalid formats**:
  - "Can you help me with [specific issue]?"
  - "What about [describe your situation]?"
  - "How does this apply to your [insert context]?"
- **Must be directly usable**: Should function as-is without any modification
- **Penalty**: Incomplete questions with templates or blanks should almost never win

**Note**: A question that fails these universal requirements can only win if all other alternatives are exceptionally poor in the specific criterion being evaluated.

## Evaluation Criteria Details

### Criteria Definition

**Criteria Name**: Exploratory Scope

**Definition:** This criterion evaluates whether the follow-up question broadens and deepens the user-LLM conversation. This criteria looks at how the question moves beyond the current viewpoints to surface related subtopics, alternative perspectives, and more nuanced inquiries—encouraging the user to consider aspects they may have overlooked.

**Contextualized Examples**: This criterion may include, but not limited to, the following examples.
- **Multi-perspective Inquiry:** Does the question encourage exploration of the topic from various angles and viewpoints?
- **Related Concepts Suggestion:** Does it actively introduce related concepts or ideas linked to the core topic?
- **Checklist Functionality:** Does it list out concepts or keywords to help the user assess their understanding?
- **In-depth Exploration:** Does it go beyond basic information to delve into deeper, more complex aspects?
- **Scope Narrowing:** Does it progressively narrow broad subjects into more specific and detailed areas?

### Understanding Exploratory Scope: Broadening AND Deepening

**Important Note**: Exploratory Scope values BOTH broadening (expanding to related areas) AND deepening (focusing on specific aspects). These are not opposites but complementary exploration strategies:

- **Broadening**: "How does this apply to other industries?" → Expands horizontally
- **Deepening**: "What specific challenges arise in implementation?" → Dives vertically
- **Both**: "How do implementation challenges differ across industries?" → Sophisticated exploration

**The best questions often do one very well, or cleverly combine both dimensions.**

### Exploratory Scope Quality Dimensions

When comparing questions, assess these quality dimensions to guide your decisions rather than assigning scores:

**Excellence in Exploratory Scope shows:**
- Skillful broadening, deepening, or combining both exploration strategies
- Insightful new dimensions or non-obvious connections
- Sophisticated understanding through thoughtful framing
- Natural next steps that users would eagerly explore

**Strong Exploratory Scope shows:**
- Effective exploration through broadening OR deepening with clear purpose
- Strategic thinking about exploration direction
- Awareness of conversation progression
- Clear value through well-targeted inquiry

**Adequate Exploratory Scope shows:**
- Attempts to explore but in predictable ways
- Basic understanding of topic connections
- Some direction but lacking focus
- Generic exploration patterns

**Weak Exploratory Scope shows:**
- Vague requests for "more" without direction
- Surface-level or yes/no inquiries
- Minimal effort to connect ideas
- Missed obvious exploration opportunities

**Very Weak Exploratory Scope shows:**
- Mere repetition or clarification requests
- No attempt to explore new territory
- Completely unfocused inquiries
- Fundamental misunderstanding of conversation direction

**Key Evaluation Points:**
- Does the question introduce related perspectives, concepts, or connections?
- Does it move from general to specific (or vice versa) purposefully?
- Is there clear exploratory intent beyond simple information gathering?
- Does the question show focused curiosity about a specific aspect?
- Would a thoughtful user naturally want to explore this direction?
- Would this question work even if the topic changes?

**Example Comparisons:**
- A: "What else?" vs B: "How does screen time affect teenagers specifically?" → B wins (generic vs specific focus)
- A: "What are other uses of this technology?" vs B: "Is social media good or bad?" → A wins (broader exploration vs simple yes/no)
- A: "How does this apply to other industries?" vs B: "How might cultural values change this?" → B wins (more insightful dimension)

**Remember**: Focus on how well each question embodies Exploratory Scope. Do not let excellence in other areas influence your evaluation for this specific criterion.

## Comparison Process

1. **Read all inputs carefully**, especially the user's question and the model's answer, understanding the full conversational context
2. **Understand the evaluation criterion**, its requirements and examples
3. **Analyze ALL follow-up question candidates** against the Exploratory Scope criterion
4. **Compare their relative strengths**:
   - Which introduces the most valuable perspectives or concepts?
   - Which best deepens or broadens the discussion?
   - Which shows the clearest exploratory intent?
   - Which would lead to the richest conversation?
5. **Determine the single winner** based on which best fulfills the criterion, preparing to explain:
   - Key strengths of the winning question
   - Critical differences that set it apart from the others
   - Why it is superior for exploratory scope compared to all alternatives
6. **Consider these differentiators**:
   - Specificity of exploration direction
   - Quality of connections made
   - Potential for meaningful discovery
   - Sophistication of framing

### Handling Apparent Ties

**CRITICAL: You must select exactly ONE winner.** When multiple questions appear similar in quality, use these tie-breakers in order:

1. **Specificity**: The more specific question wins (e.g., "impact on teenagers" beats "impact on people")
2. **Context Alignment**: The question better aligned with the user's original intent and conversation context wins
3. **User Value**: The question more likely to uncover information the user didn't know to ask for or would find particularly interesting wins
4. **Exploration Potential**: The question opening richer follow-up paths wins
5. **Clarity**: If all else equal, the clearer, more direct question wins

Remember: Even questions at similar quality levels have differences. Your job is to find and articulate these differences to select the single best candidate.

## Output Format

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "id": "[copy exact id from candidate 1]",
      "text": "[copy exact text from candidate 1]"
    },
    {
      "id": "[copy exact id from candidate 2]",
      "text": "[copy exact text from candidate 2]"
    }
    // ... include all candidates provided in the input
  ],
  "winner": "[the exact ID of the winning candidate]",
  "reason": "[Detailed but concise justification explaining: (1) Key strengths of the winning question regarding Exploratory Scope, (2) How it compares to and differs from the other candidates, (3) Specific elements that made it superior to all alternatives, (4) Why the other candidates fell short in comparison]"
}
```

**CRITICAL**: Use the EXACT values from the input data.

**Example**: If the candidates have IDs "candidate_A", "candidate_B", "candidate_C", etc., and the third candidate wins, then winner should be "candidate_C".

**WARNING**: The winner field MUST contain the exact candidate ID string, not "candidate 1", "candidate C", "the third option", or any other label.

## Final Reminders

- **Be decisive**: You MUST choose exactly ONE winner from the candidates. No ties are acceptable.
- **Find the key differences**: Even similar questions have distinguishing factors that make one superior
- **Stay focused**: Evaluate ONLY on Exploratory Scope, not other qualities
- **Be specific**: Vague comparisons like "more exploratory" are insufficient
- **Consider impact**: Which single question would lead to the most valuable exploration?
- **Justify thoroughly**: Explain not just which is best, but WHY it surpasses all others
