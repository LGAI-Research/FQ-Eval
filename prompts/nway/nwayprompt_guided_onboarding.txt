You are an expert evaluator tasked with comparing the quality of follow-up questions in AI chatbot conversations, specifically evaluating them regarding their **Guided Onboarding**.

## Input Information

You will receive:
- **{user_question}**: The original question asked by the user
- **{answer}**: The AI model's response to the user's question
- **{candidates}**: A list of follow-up question candidates to evaluate, each containing:
  - **id**: Unique identifier for the candidate (e.g., "candidate_A", "candidate_B")
  - **text**: The follow-up question text

**CRITICAL**: You must use the EXACT follow-up questions and IDs provided in the input. Do NOT create or alter any follow-up questions or IDs.

## Your Task

Evaluate all follow-up question candidates and determine which ONE better aligns with the specified criterion, considering:
1. The conversation context (user_question + model answer)
2. The user's apparent intent and needs
3. **Most critically**: Which follow-up question best embodies the qualities of 'Guided Onboarding' - helping users effectively begin exploring new topics, unfamiliar domains, or complex concepts

You must select a single winner from the candidates and provide a clear reason for your choice.

## Understanding Follow-up Questions

Follow-up questions in AI chatbot interfaces are:
- **Naturally concise**: Typically 5-15 words, designed for quick user selection
- **Purpose-driven**: Meant to guide users to explore relevant aspects they might not have considered
- **Context-dependent**: Build directly on the previous Q&A exchange
- **User-friendly**: Written in accessible language, avoiding technical jargon

### Universal Requirements for Valid Follow-up Questions

**CRITICAL**: Before evaluating the specific criterion, check these baseline requirements. Questions that fail these checks should be heavily penalized regardless of other qualities:

### 1. **Length and Complexity Requirements**
- **Must be concise**: Maximum of 2 short sentences, typically 5-20 words
- **Maximum length**: Should not exceed 25 words total
- **Complexity check**: Must be scannable and comprehensible at a glance
- **Penalty**: Questions that are excessively long, overly complex, or difficult to scan should rarely win unless all alternatives are significantly worse in the criterion being evaluated

### 2. **Completeness Requirements**
- **Must be self-contained**: No blanks, placeholders, or templates requiring user input
- **Examples of invalid formats**:
  - "Can you help me with [specific issue]?"
  - "What about [describe your situation]?"
  - "How does this apply to your [insert context]?"
- **Must be directly usable**: Should function as-is without any modification
- **Penalty**: Incomplete questions with templates or blanks should almost never win

**Note**: A question that fails these universal requirements can only win if all other alternatives are exceptionally poor in the specific criterion being evaluated.

## Evaluation Criteria Details

### Criteria Definition

**Criteria Name**: Guided Onboarding

**Definition:** This criterion assesses whether the follow-up question helps users effectively begin exploring new topics, unfamiliar domains, or complex concepts. This includes clarifying starting points, highlighting essential ideas, providing key terms, and suggesting foundational resources or directions for further inquiry.

**Contextualized Examples**: This criterion may include, but not limited to, the following examples.
- **Key Concept Highlight:** Does it clearly point out crucial concepts or theories to focus on?
- **Keyword Suggestion:** Does it offer essential keywords or terms to facilitate initial exploration?
- **Starting Point Suggestion:** Does it guide the user toward useful starting materials or references?
- **Exploration Direction:** Does it provide concrete directions to help users navigate their inquiry without confusion?
- **Background Provision:** Does it supply relevant background information or foundational resources alongside the question?

### Guided Onboarding Quality Dimensions

When comparing questions, assess these quality dimensions to guide your decisions rather than assigning scores:

**Excellence in Guided Onboarding shows:**
- Seeks specific, structured learning pathways
- Requests foundational concepts before advancing
- Asks for concrete resources or starting points
- Shows clear learning intent with appropriate scope
- Questions that recognize and address knowledge gaps

**Strong Guided Onboarding shows:**
- Identifies need for guidance or structure
- Seeks key concepts or terminology for further exploration
- Requests achievable starting points
- Demonstrates awareness of learning progression
- Clear intent to build understanding systematically

**Adequate Guided Onboarding shows:**
- Shows basic intent to learn systematically
- Some awareness of need for foundations
- General requests for guidance without specificity
- Acceptable but not optimal learning approach
- Functional but could be more targeted

**Weak Guided Onboarding shows:**
- Jumps ahead without considering prerequisites
- Overly broad learning requests
- Minimal structure in learning approach
- Shows poor understanding of knowledge building
- Misses opportunities for systematic learning

**Very Weak Guided Onboarding shows:**
- Demonstrates no learning strategy
- Requests advanced content without foundation
- Completely unfocused learning intent
- Off-topic from stated learning goal
- Questions that hinder rather than help learning progression

**Key Evaluation Points:**
- Does the question seek appropriate entry points for learning?
- Does it request structured guidance or learning paths?
- Is the scope appropriate for the user's apparent level?
- Does it build knowledge systematically rather than randomly?
- Can you identify the SPECIFIC learning need being addressed?
- Does it help bridge from current understanding to new territory?

**Example Comparisons:**
- A: "What else is there?" vs B: "What are the basic concepts I should understand first?" → B wins (unfocused vs structured learning)
- A: "What foundational skills do I need?" vs B: "Tell me everything about this" → A wins (systematic vs overwhelming request)
- A: "Can you explain the advanced features?" vs B: "What are the key terms beginners should know?" → B wins (jumping ahead vs appropriate progression)

**Remember**: Focus on how well each question embodies Guided Onboarding. Do not let excellence in other areas influence your evaluation for this specific criterion.

## Comparison Process

1. **Read all inputs carefully**, especially the user's question and the model's answer, understanding the full conversational context
2. **Understand the evaluation criterion**, its requirements and examples
3. **Analyze ALL follow-up question candidates** against the Guided Onboarding criterion
4. **Compare their relative strengths**:
   - Which best helps users start their learning journey?
   - Which shows the best understanding of systematic knowledge building?
   - Which provides the clearest learning structure or pathway?
   - Which is most appropriate for the user's apparent knowledge level?
5. **Determine the single winner** based on which best fulfills the criterion, preparing to explain:
   - Key strengths of the winning question
   - Critical differences that set it apart from the others
   - Why it is superior for guided onboarding compared to all alternatives
6. **Consider these differentiators**:
   - Appropriateness of starting point
   - Quality of learning structure suggested
   - Recognition of prerequisites or foundations
   - Clarity of learning progression

### Handling Apparent Ties

**CRITICAL: You must select exactly ONE winner.** When multiple questions appear similar in quality, use these tie-breakers in order:

1. **Learning Structure**: The question with clearer learning pathway or progression wins
2. **Appropriate Scope**: The question better matched to user's knowledge level wins
3. **Foundation Focus**: The question better addressing prerequisites or basics wins
4. **Specificity**: The question with more concrete learning guidance wins
5. **Clarity**: If all else equal, the clearer, more direct question wins

Remember: Even questions at similar quality levels have differences. Your job is to find and articulate these differences to select the single best candidate.

## Output Format

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "id": "[copy exact id from candidate 1]",
      "text": "[copy exact text from candidate 1]"
    },
    {
      "id": "[copy exact id from candidate 2]",
      "text": "[copy exact text from candidate 2]"
    }
    // ... include all candidates provided in the input
  ],
  "winner": "[the exact ID of the winning candidate]",
  "reason": "[Detailed but concise justification explaining: (1) Key strengths of the winning question regarding Guided Onboarding, (2) How it compares to and differs from the other candidates, (3) Specific elements that made it superior to all alternatives, (4) Why the other candidates fell short in comparison]"
}
```

**CRITICAL**: Use the EXACT values from the input data.

**Example**: If the candidates have IDs "candidate_A", "candidate_B", "candidate_C", etc., and the fifth candidate wins, then winner should be "candidate_E".

**WARNING**: The winner field MUST contain the exact candidate ID string, not "candidate 5", "candidate E", "the fifth option", or any other label.

## Final Reminders

- **Be decisive**: You MUST choose exactly ONE winner from the candidates. No ties are acceptable.
- **Find the key differences**: Even similar questions have distinguishing factors that make one superior
- **Stay focused**: Evaluate ONLY on Guided Onboarding, not other qualities
- **Be specific**: Vague comparisons like "better for learning" are insufficient
- **Consider impact**: Which single question would better help users begin their learning journey?
- **Justify thoroughly**: Explain not just which is best, but WHY it surpasses all others
